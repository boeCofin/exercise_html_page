                    <h2>Some text about birds</h2>
                    <p>"I believe I can fly" - a bird</p>
                    <p>
                        Originally, these same birds were wild birds that lived and died in the wild.
                        It wasnâ€™t until people realized their importance and usefulness that they were captured,
                        raised in captivity and bred in farms. Because domesticated birds are practically a different
                        species than their wild counterparts, domesticated birds and wild birds might share physical
                        appearance, but differ in other ways.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Wild birds must <b>hunt</b> own food</li>
                            <li>Wild birds don't get as <b>old</b></li>
                            <li>Wild birds are important for the <b>ecosystem</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        Without the domestication of birds, there would be an immense shortage of food,
                        household products (pillows), clothing (down jackets) and eggs. What would we do without our
                        scrambled eggs at breakfast or our subzero-rated coats? Domesticated birds are an essential part
                        of human survival.

                        However, wild birds have their own place in the order of things. Without wild birds,
                        whole ecosystems would fall apart; without prey, predators would die off and with them entire
                        species of animals would fall extinct.
